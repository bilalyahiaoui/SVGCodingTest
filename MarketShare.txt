I started off by forking the repository and then cloning a local copy. I then created an MVC project through Visual Studio. I started off by downloading a Nuget Package (Frappe) and used their documentation found on their website to see show I can create the different charts I needed for this exercice. I started by first putting in some dummy data to make sure the UI was working. Once I saw the charts were appearing, I worked on the download portion. Once I knew that was working, I created a model class. This was to ensure that if I were to get more data in the future, my code can be re-usable. In the Home Controller, I'm creating a list of vehicles to pass along to my view. In the view, I'm getting my list of vehicles and manipulating the data in order to pass the right type of data to my Frappe chart. Once I was able to get bar chart to display correctly, I worked on the market share portion. I went back to the model to add some business logic. I needed a method to fetch the market share per vehicle type. Once I return that list, I'm sending it back to the view to display my pie chart. I used Google Chrome mainly to test my code. Everything was a manual test for this exercice. I could write some unit tests but it wasn't a requirement.
